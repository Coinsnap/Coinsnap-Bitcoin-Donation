# Installation #

# 1. Install the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin from our Github page #

If you don’t want to install Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin directly from your WordPress backend, download the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin from the [Coinsnap Github page here](https://github.com/Coinsnap/Bitcoin-Donation).

Find the green button labeled **Code**. When you click on it, the menu opens and Download ZIP appears. Here you can download the latest version of the Coinsnap plugin to your computer.

Then use the “**Upload plugin**” function to install it. Click on “**Install now**” and the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin will be added to your WordPress website. It can then be connected to the Coinsnap payment gateway or BTCPay server.

As soon as the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin is installed and activated, a message will appear asking you to configure the plugin settings.

Next, you will connect the plugin with your Coinsnap account.


### 1.1. Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation Settings ###

After you have installed and activated the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin, you need to configure the Coinsnap settings. Go to **Bitcoin Donations -> Settings** [1] in the black sidebar on the left.

Now choose your payment gateway **Coinsnap** [1]. (You can also choose BTCPay server if you are using one, and then fill in the respective information.)
Then you’ll have to enter your **Coinsnap Store ID** and your **Coinsnap API Key**. [2] (See below to learn how to retrieve these from your Coinsnap account.)

As soon as you’ve pasted the Store ID and the API Key into their fields, click on **check**. If you see a green message next to it saying **Connection successful**, your plugin is ready to accept Bitcoin donations and credit them to your Lightning wallet.


### 1.2. Enter Store ID and API Key in your Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation Settings ###

Go to the **Settings** menu item in your Coinsnap merchant admin backend [https://app.coinsnap.io/login](https://app.coinsnap.io/login). Then click on **Store** and you will see your Coinsnap **Store ID** and the Coinsnap **API Key** in the **Store** section.

**Copy** these two strings and **paste** them into the matching fields in the **Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation settings** in your WordPress backend.

Click on the “**Save changes**” button at the bottom of the page to apply and save the settings. You are ready to start selling for Bitcoin now: Just create a donation form and place it via the shortcode on your website.

## YOU ARE SET TO SELL FOR BITCOIN NOW! To be sure all works fine, you should now... ##

### 1.3. Test the payment method in a Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation form on your website ###

After all settings have been made, a test transaction should be carried out.

Choose an amount you want to donate in your test donation and click the payment button. Fill in the information you decided and configured to gather.

You will now be redirected to the Bitcoin-Lightning payment page to make your contribution by scanning the displayed QR code and authorizing the payment. After successful payment, you will see a confirmation that the payment has been transferred.


## 2. Install the Coinsnap Bitcoin Donation plugin from the WordPress plugin repository ##
